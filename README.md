Yes. It's written in HTML and styled with CSS. Stay with me now.

The main benefit is it doesn't need a compilation step like LaTeX or having to open a heavy app like Word. You could use notepad to edit it if you wanted to. 

Open the HTML in your web browser and type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> to get the pdf copy.

It adds/modifies some styles using the `@page` and `@media print` rules to make the pdf copy look good when printed.

I also tried to keep the HTML as semantic as I could, using as little generic tags as possible.
