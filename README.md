# My Resume Template
Yes. It's written in HTML and styled with CSS. Stay with me now.

## Why

The main benefit is it doesn't need a compilation step like LaTeX or having to open a heavy app like Word. You could edit it in notepad if you wanted to. 

Open the page in your web browser and type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> to get the pdf copy. It's also responsive.

The CSS uses `@page` and `@media print` rules to make the pdf copy look good when printed.
